# EEG-ITBS Performance and Analysis 

This project involves classifying EEG waves (Alpha, Beta, Theta, etc.) using a trained model [Random Forest] and visualizing behavioral performance metrics (Accuracy and Reaction Time) via a React-based dashboard.
 
## Features 
- **EEG Classification:** Model trained to classify EEG waves. 
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard built with React and Recharts library to visualize Accuracy vs. Reaction Time.
- **Data Selection:** Dropdown to choose among Participants representing different groups:
  - Active 2-Back (`A2B_performance_metrics.csv`)
  - Active 3-Back (`A3B_performance_metrics.csv`)
  - Sham 2-Back (`S2B_performance_metrics.csv`)
  - Sham 3-Back (`S3B_performance_metrics.csv`)
 
## Setup Instructions
